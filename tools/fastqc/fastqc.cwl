label: "FastQC: A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data"
doc: "FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis. http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/"

    doc: "Files come from raw casava output. Files in the same sample group (differing only by the group number) will be analysed as a set rather than individually. Sequences with the filter flag set in the header will be excluded from the analysis. Files must have the same names given to them by casava (including being gzipped and ending with .gz) otherwise they won't be grouped together correctly."
