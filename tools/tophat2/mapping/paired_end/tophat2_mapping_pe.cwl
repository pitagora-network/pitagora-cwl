label: "TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. [cwl for paired end]"
doc: "TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. It aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons. http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml"

    label: "re-align reads for which the edit distance of an alignment obtained in a previous mapping step is above or equal to this option value"
    doc: "This option can direct TopHat to re-align reads for which the edit distance of an alignment obtained in a previous mapping step is above or equal to this option value. If you set this option to 0, TopHat will map every read in all the mapping steps (transcriptome if you provided gene annotations, genome, and finally splice variants detected by TopHat), reporting the best possible alignment found in any of these mapping steps. This may greatly increase the mapping accuracy at the expense of an increase in running time. The default value for this option is set such that TopHat will not try to realign reads already mapped in earlier steps"

    doc: "This is the expected (mean) inner distance between mate pairs. For, example, for paired end runs with fragments selected at 300bp, where each end is 50bp, you should set -r to be 200. The default is 50bp."

Note that individual spliced alignments may span a junction with fewer than this many bases on one side. However, every junction involved in spliced alignments is supported by at least one read with this many bases on each side.	This must be at least 3 and the default is 8."

    doc: "Supply TopHat with a set of gene model annotations and/or known transcripts, as a GTF 2.2 or GFF3 formatted file. If this option is provided, TopHat will first extract the transcript sequences and use Bowtie to align reads to this virtual transcriptome first. Only the reads that do not fully map to the transcriptome will then be mapped on the genome. The reads that did map on the transcriptome will be converted to genomic mappings (spliced as needed) and merged with the novel mappings and junctions in the final tophat output."
