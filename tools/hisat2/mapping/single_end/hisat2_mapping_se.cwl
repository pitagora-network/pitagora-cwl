    type: string
  fq:
    label: "Read file"
    doc: "Comma-separated list of files containing unpaired reads to be aligned, e.g. lane1.fq,lane2.fq,lane3.fq,lane4.fq. Reads may be a mix of different lengths."

  out_sam_name:
    label: "Name of file to write SAM alignments to"
    doc: "Name of file to write SAM alignments to (default: out.sam)"
    type: string?
    default: out.sam
  dta:
    label: "Report alignments tailored for transcript assemblers"
    doc: "Report alignments tailored for transcript assemblers including StringTie. With this option, HISAT2 requires longer anchor lengths for de novo discovery of splice sites. This leads to fewer alignments with short-anchors, which helps transcript assemblers improve significantly in computation and memory usage."
    type: boolean?
    default: true
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --downstream-transcriptome-assembly
  dta_cufflinks:
    label: "Report alignments tailored specifically for Cufflinks"
    doc: "Report alignments tailored specifically for Cufflinks. In addition to what HISAT2 does with the above option (--dta), With this option, HISAT2 looks for novel splice sites with three signals (GT/AG, GC/AG, AT/AC), but all user-provided splice sites are used irrespective of their signals. HISAT2 produces an optional field, XS:A:[+-], for every spliced alignment"
    type: boolean?
    default: true
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --dta-cufflinks
  time:
    label: "Print the wall-clock time"
    doc: "Print the wall-clock time required to load the index files and align the reads. This is printed to the 'standard error' ('stderr') filehandle."
    type: boolean?

    inputBinding:
      prefix: --time
  nthreads:
    label: "Launch NTHREADS parallel search threads"
    doc: "Launch NTHREADS parallel search threads (default: 1). Threads will run on separate processors/cores and synchronize when parsing reads and outputting alignments. Searching for alignments is highly parallel, and speedup is close to linear. Increasing -p increases HISAT2's memory footprint. E.g. when aligning to a human genome index, increasing -p from 1 to 8 increases the memory footprint by a few hundred megabytes. This option is only available if bowtie is linked with the pthreads library (i.e. if BOWTIE_PTHREADS=0 is not specified at build time)."
